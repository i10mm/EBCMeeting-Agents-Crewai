## Welcome to the EBC Meeting Preparation Report Toolkit!

This toolkit is designed to help you, as a Client Manager for Global System Integrators (GSI), prepare for Executive Briefing Center (EBC) meetings with your clients. Using the CrewAI framework, we can automate the process of gathering information, analyzing industry trends, and generating a comprehensive report that will help your clients understand how NVIDIA AI solutions can benefit their business.

Agents:

* Research Agent: Gather information about the target company (e.g., Unilever) and its industry.
* Industry Analysis Agent: Analyze the target company's industry, focusing on AI adoption and competition.
* NVIDIA Expert Agent: Identify gaps in the target company's AI implementation and recommend relevant NVIDIA solutions.
* Meeting Strategy Agent: Develop talking points, questions, and strategic angles for the meeting based on the gathered information.

Tasks:

* Research Task: Conduct thorough research on people and companies involved in the meeting.
* Industry Analysis Task: Analyze industry trends, challenges, and opportunities related to AI.
* NVIDIA Solutions Recommendation Task: Compile all gathered information into a concise and informative briefing document.
* Meeting Strategy Task: Develop a document outlining talking points, questions for the client, and strategic angles for the meeting.

To use this toolkit, simply provide the stock symbol or URL of the target company as input, optionally provide public linkedin profile urls for potential attendees, and the CrewAI framework will take care of the rest. The output will be a comprehensive EBC meeting preparation report that will help your clients understand how NVIDIA AI solutions can benefit their business.

We hope this toolkit will help you prepare for your EBC meetings and showcase the value of NVIDIA AI solutions to your clients. Good luck!
