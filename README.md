  <heading2>CrewAI Workflow:</heading2>
  <paragraph>CrewAI orchestrates a dynamic workflow where agents collaborate to accomplish tasks efficiently.</paragraph>
  <paragraph>Let's delve into the step-by-step process:</paragraph>

  <bulletlist>
    <bullet>Define agents with distinct roles, goals, Backstory and provide required tools.</bullet>
    <bullet>Specify tasks with clear descriptions, expected outputs, and assigned agents.</bullet>
    <bullet>Create a crew, choosing either a sequential or hierarchical process.</bullet>
  </bulletlist>

  <heading3>2. Task Execution:</heading3>
  <bulletlist>
    <bullet>Sequential Process:
      <bulletlist>
        <bullet>Agents execute tasks in the predefined order.</bullet>
      </bulletlist>
    </bullet>
    <bullet>Hierarchical Process:
      <bulletlist>
        <bullet>Task Delegation: A manager agent allocates tasks among crew members based on their roles and capabilities.</bullet>
        <bullet>Result Validation: The manager evaluates outcomes to ensure they meet the required standards.</bullet>
        <bullet>Efficient Workflow: Emulates corporate structures, providing an organized approach to task management.</bullet>
      </bulletlist>
